# Deep Learning - Predicting Diabetes Progression using Artificial Neural Networks

Dataset:
Use the Diabetes dataset available in the sklearn library.

Key components to be fulfilled :

1.Loading and Preprocessing 
 * Load the Diabetes dataset from sklearn.
 * Handle any missing values if present.
 * Normalize the features to ensure better performance of the ANN model.
   
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Perform EDA to understand the distribution of features and the target variable.
  * Visualize the relationships between features and the target variable.

3.Building the ANN Model
  * Design a simple ANN architecture with at least one hidden layer.
  * Use appropriate activation functions .

4.Training the ANN Model
  * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  * Train the model on the training data.
  * Use an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
    
5.Evaluating the Model
  * Evaluate the model on the testing data.
  * Report the performance metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, RÂ² Score).

6.Improving the Model (5 marks)
  * Experiment with different architectures, activation functions, or hyperparameters to improve the model performance.
  * Report the changes made and the corresponding improvement in performance.
